            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>I am 20 years old. I was born in Nepal but raised in Maryland.</p>
            <p>I go to Community College of Baltimore County and I am majoring in Information Technology.</p>
            <p>I have seen many movies where people make websites and games for big companies. That is what got me interested in wanting to make websites and games.</p>
            <p>I know it can be hard making codes for websites and games but with enough practice, I'm pretty sure it will be easy after.</p>
