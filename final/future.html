            <h2>What am I interested doing in the future?</h2>
            <p>I am interested in becoming a website designer, a video game designer, and a part time photographer.</p>
            <p>I am interested in doing anything that involves technology.</p>
            <p>I always loved Technology and it has always fascinated me how they made a bunch of codes that work for a whole lot of things.</p>
            <p>I really want to dig deeper into all of this.</p>
