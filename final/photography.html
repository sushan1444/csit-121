            <h2>Why I like photography?</h2>
            <p>Photography seems so unique to me. I feel like everything can be photographed and it would not even look bad.</p>
            <p>I have been taking photos on my phone and editing them in lightroom. I gotten pretty good at editing photos.</p>
            <p>I have been watching over 50 videos on how to edit and take great photos.</p>
            <p>But now, I use a Canon Eos R to take pictures and videos. This camera has a lot of features that I am yet to discover.</p>
